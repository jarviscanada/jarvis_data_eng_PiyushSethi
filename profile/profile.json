      "description": "Designed a system for monitoring cluster health and resource usage in real-time. Utilized Linux shell scripts to collect hardware specifications and real-time system resource usage data. The data is inserted into a PostgreSQL database for storage and analysis. Additionally, SQL queries are used to retrieve and generate reports based on the collected data. The system also leverages Docker for containerizing the PostgreSQL database, making it easy to deploy and scale the monitoring system. Git was used for version control, and Cron was employed to automate the periodic collection of resource usage data. The solution was designed to run on multiple nodes within a Linux-based cluster, offering scalability and flexibility for large-scale monitoring.",

      "description": "Implemented a text search utility similar to the Unix grep command. The application processes input files, searches for specified patterns using Java Regular Expressions (Regex APIs), and writes matching lines to an output file. Built using Core Java, the application utilizes Java I/O APIs (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter) for efficient file handling. Maven was used for project dependency management, and the app was containerized using Docker to enable easy deployment and portability. The application supports processing large files and leverages Java Streams for optimized performance.",
